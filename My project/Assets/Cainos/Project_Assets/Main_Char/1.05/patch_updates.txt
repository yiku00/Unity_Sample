hoods swapped and flipped for better looks in walk, run, swing south animations
new organization of .xcf, baldy, template, and costumed layers created with sword flash and hair tuft as accessory layeres
default composite character no longer includes hair tuft but it's available as a layer in the .xcf and png
.xcf in indexed mode to get rid of palette deviations
some limbs have been repositioned
dust effect removed until a better quality is produced

notes

Trying out shaded background limbs on the new run animation template, but costume is consistent
shirt + tunic will be separate layers in a future release
cape requires small alterations to work without short for now
A lot of elements from the 2021 template were borrowed
looking to write some hacks to use less frames for various animations
going back through my concepts from older template versions for updates to suggest to theoretical community
some time will be spent re-arranging and possiby re-titling the product page
