Thanks for purchasing this animation set! Your support is appreciated and you can reach out to me @robaweslot on twitter if you have any suggestions or feedback

There are a couple ways to use this product. You're best value will come from using GIMP the free image editor and open the .xcf files to see what composes the character sprites.
If you don't have GIMP then no worries, I've separated the layers into individual .png files.
If you'd like to jump right in and use a character then the hero-complete.png in the root directory will work fine, and character_variants contains a variety of color swaps. 
If you're using a lighting engine in your project there's a folder for normals that includes normals by layer, slightly customized but otherwise generated through GIMP and color curving.

More info about the project :

Over the course of the pandemic I've been working off and on on creating a smooth character template for a variety of games.
Unforutnately feature creep has swallowed the project - it's over 400 frames and I'm basically redoing all of them again.
These five animations cover about a quarter of the animations the template has.
I'm going to be eagerly looking for sales information and feedback to determine where to go with my character projects.

Enjoy the set - check my other itchio page for monsters to set the underdogs against - they aren't underdogs unless they're outnumbered!
